# Secure_password_checker_password
Secure password Checker using python and API

Hi! 

This is a password checker app that lets you check if your password was ever breached and 
if it was breached then how many times it was breached!

Don't worry, this app does not sends your password to any servers. All remains local. only parts of password are used to get 
information about breaching!

Instruction to run this app:
1. In terminal type: python3 checkmypass.py password1 password2 password3 (put passwords you want to check with space)
2. Minimum 1 password.

Hope it helps!
